## Connecting Multiple Clients to a Server Using Python 3 Sockets
## This socket programming guide will demonstrate how to establish connections with multiple clients to a server using Python 3 sockets. It covers sending messages from clients to the server and from the server to clients. We will also show you how to host your socket server locally or globally on the internet, allowing anyone to connect. This utilizes Python 3 socket and threading modules.

## Server-Client Communication
This guide aims to manage communication between a server and one or more clients. The server accepts connections from clients and then handles incoming messages from clients or sends messages to clients. Clients connect to the server, send messages to the server, and receive messages from the server.

## How to Use
Starting the Server:

To start the server, run the server.py file.
The server will accept connections from clients on the IP address and port number you specify.
Starting Clients:

To start clients, run the client.py file for each client.
Each client will connect to the server and be able to communicate with the server.
Sending and Receiving Messages:

Clients can send messages to the server and receive messages from the server.
The server can process incoming messages from clients and respond to clients.
Hosting the Server Locally and on the Internet
This guide provides two methods to host your server on a local network or make it accessible on the internet.

## Hosting on a Local Network:
To host your server on your local network, set the server's IP address to your local IP address and use the port number you've chosen. This way, devices on your local network can connect to the server.

## Hosting on the Internet:
To host your server on the internet, use your public IP address and port forwarding. This allows anyone on the internet to access your server. Be cautious for security reasons and take necessary security measures.

## Conclusion
This guide serves as a fundamental step to learn how to communicate with multiple clients on a server using Python 3 socket programming. You can use this foundational knowledge to develop your client and server code and create more complex applications.
